# Unity Architecture sample; Scene flow and Data Persistence on a Breakout-like game

Basic implementation of a persistence data system between scenes and sessions using an event-driven architecture based on Scriptable Objects.

Showcase use of Scriptable Objects, Modular SaveSystem, Addressable, Assembly Definition files and other good programming practices.

Inspired by the following work:
- Unity Open Project -  [ChopChop](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1)
- Unite Austin 2017 - [Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) with Ryan Hipple

Initially part of the [Unity Junior Pathway - Data persistence mission](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo), but I ended up adding many more features and improving the
architecture of the proposed solution, so it can be addressed to a more middle/advance programmers, and apply the concepts in bigger projects, 
where using good programing practices become crucial in the long term.
