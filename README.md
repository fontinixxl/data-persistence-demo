# data-persistence-demo

Basic implementation of a system for persisting data between scenes and sessions using an event-driven architecture based on Scriptable Objectes.

This game is intended to be kind of a reference on how to following a set of good practices and principles for a better game architecture in Unity.

Showcast use of Scriptable Objects, Modular SaveSystem, Addressables for Scene Management and other good practices.

Based on the following work:
- Unity Open Project: https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1
- Unite Austin 2017 - Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects, with Ryan Hipple: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk

WIP documentation; more to come soon;)
