# Unity Scene flow and Data Persistence demo

Basic implementation of a persistence data system between scenes and sessions using an event-driven architecture based on Scriptable Objects.

Showcase use of Scriptable Objects, Modular SaveSystem, Addressable, Assembly Definition files and other good programming practices.

Inspired by the following work:
- Unity Open Project: https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1
- Unite Austin 2017 - Game Architecture with Scriptable Objects, with Ryan Hipple: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk

>TODO: Add credit to the base project from Unity Learn
> 
> Draft: This was initially part of the Unity Junior Pathway; Data persistence mission, but I ended up adding many more features and improving the
> architecture of the proposed solution, so it can be addressed to a more middle/advance programmers, and apply the concepts in bigger projects, 
> where using good programing practices has more sense.

WIP documentation; more to come soon;)
